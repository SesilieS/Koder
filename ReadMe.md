# PRO1001 Exam Project  

## Overview  
This repository contains the code for my PRO1001 exam project, which focuses on building a web application using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project demonstrates my understanding of front-end development concepts and showcases my ability to create interactive and responsive web pages.

I was asked to make a website for "FRAM". They focus on selling vegetables from local farms i Norway. The full design was given in Figma.

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: Structuring the content of the web application.  
- **CSS**: Styling and layout design to ensure a visually appealing user interface.  
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to the application.  

## Features  
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.  
- Interactive elements powered by JavaScript.  
- Clean and organized code structure.   

## How to navigate
- The Front page has the names index.html, style.css and script.js
- The Products page has the names produce.html/css/js
- and the Chatbot page has the names chatbot.html/css/js
All the pictures can be found in the Images-folder. 
Start with opening the Front page and navigate to the Products and the Chatbot via the menu on the left side on the page. When you want to go back to the Front page you can always click on the name "FRAM" on the top of the page.

Enjoy!
